## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

- Added a function used to load a dataset for training
- Updated the train_nn function with a more thorough example
- Kept the train_nn example wrapped with \dontrun{} because using \donttest{} will cause an error when running R CMD check as it takes well over a minute to run

## Test environments
* ubuntu 10.04.1 (JupyterHub), R 4.0.3
* local windows install, R 4.0.3

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs, WARNINGs, or NOTEs.
